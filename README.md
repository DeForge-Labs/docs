This is the documentation repository for Deforge. All guides and details are also stored here.

## How to add to the documentation ?
For now, you can only add details about nodes in Deforge. To do that, you will need to create an [issue](https://github.com/DeForge-Labs/docs/issues/new?template=add-node-documentation.md). Specifically the `Add Node Documentation` template. Then follow the template guide accordingly to complete your issue.

Once you are done with that, a pull request should open automatically if your issue format was correct. We will take a look at the pull request and approve it if it is correct.

For a sample issue, you can check [#7](https://github.com/DeForge-Labs/docs/issues/7). Its corresponding pull request is [#8](https://github.com/DeForge-Labs/docs/pull/8).
