This guide will help you create documentation for nodes in Deforge. Proper documentation is essential for users to understand the functionality and usage of each node.

## Overview
Node documentation is written in MDX files and they are stored in their respective folders under `content/docs/library/nodes/`. Each node should have its own MDX file that includes a title, description, and any relevant examples or usage instructions.

The node documentation file name should match the node's identifier(`type` field in node's `config`). It should be located in a folder named after the node's category.

There are multiple tools and ways to create node documentation. They are explained in the following sections.

## Using the Node Documentation Generator
Deforge provides a Node Documentation Generator that can automatically create a basic MDX file for a node based on its configuration. To use the generator, follow these steps:
<Steps>
<Step>
Go to the following URL: [Node Documentation Generator](https://json-to-full-mdx.netlify.app/)
</Step>
<Step>
On the page, you will see a text area where you can paste the JSON configuration of your node (Left column).
</Step>
<Step>
Copy the JSON configuration of your node and paste it into the text area. The text area should show a sample JSON by default.
</Step>
<Step>
After pasting the JSON, click on the "Generate MDX" button. If the JSON is valid, the right column will display the generated MDX content.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy the generated MDX content using the "Copy to Clipboard" button and create a new MDX file in the appropriate category folder under `content/docs/library/nodes/`. The file name should match the node's identifier.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the copied MDX content into the new MDX file and save it.
</Step>
<Step>
You can now further edit the MDX file to add more details. You need to add the following details :
- Image links in the `<ImageZoom>` component. Images for both light and dark modes should be provided.
- Longer description in the "Description" section.
- Common use cases in the "Common Use Cases" section.
- Optionally, you can add any other information as needed for the node to function.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using the VSCode Snippet
If you prefer to write the documentation manually, you can use the VSCode snippet `node` to create a template for the node documentation. It will create the basic structure of the MDX file as shown in the [example](#example) above.

When writing the documentation manually, you will need to format the inputs, outputs and fields sections into tables using our custom table tags.

You can use the following tool to quickly format your `inputs`, `outputs` and `fields` arrays into the required table format: [Node Table Formatter](https://json-to-mdx.netlify.app/)

## Finalizing the Documentation
After creating the documentation file, you may want to visualise it. So the following steps will demonstrate how to run the documentation locally and preview your pages.

<Steps>
<Step>
Clone the Deforge Docs repository from GitHub if you haven't already:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeForge-Labs/docs.git
```
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd docs
```
</Step>
<Step>
Install the dependencies:
```npm
npm install
```
</Step>
<Step>
Start the development server:
```npm
npm run dev
```
</Step>
<Step>
Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/docs/library/nodes/` to view the documentation. Navigate to your newly created node documentation to verify that everything looks correct.
</Step>
